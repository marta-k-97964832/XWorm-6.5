# Xworm 6.5: Advanced System Management and Recovery Suite

## Overview

Welcome to the official repository for **Xworm 6.5**, the latest iteration of our robust and versatile system management and recovery suite. Xworm 6.5 is engineered to provide advanced functionalities for legitimate system administrators, cybersecurity professionals engaged in ethical penetration testing, and users requiring sophisticated tools for data recovery and remote access within their authorized environments.

This release represents a significant leap forward, focusing on enhanced security, streamlined performance, and a refined feature set tailored to meet the demanding requirements of modern IT infrastructures. We have meticulously updated and optimized key components, ensuring that Xworm 6.5 delivers unparalleled efficiency and reliability.

## Key Features & Enhancements in Xworm 6.5

### 1. Advanced Password Recovery (Logger-like Functionality)

Xworm 6.5 introduces a powerful **New Password Recovery** module designed to assist in legitimate password retrieval across all major web browsers. This feature operates with a "logger-like" efficiency, allowing authorized users to recover access credentials from systems they are authorized to manage. Whether you're a system administrator needing to restore access for a user, or performing a security audit to identify weak points in credential storage, this module provides comprehensive capabilities. It's built with precision to ensure accurate and swift recovery, minimizing downtime and supporting robust system oversight.

### 2. HVNC: Fully Updated, Clean & Smooth Operation

The **Hidden Virtual Network Computing (HVNC)** component in Xworm 6.5 has undergone a complete overhaul. We are proud to present a version that is fully updated, optimized for clean execution, and offers an exceptionally smooth user experience. HVNC allows authorized remote access to a system's graphical interface without disrupting the primary user session, making it an invaluable tool for background maintenance, non-intrusive monitoring, and discreet administrative tasks. The enhancements in this version ensure greater stability, reduced resource consumption, and improved responsiveness, facilitating seamless remote management operations.

### 3. Streamlined Security & Performance

In our continuous effort to provide the most secure and efficient tools, Xworm 6.5 has been carefully reviewed and optimized:

*   **Removed Outdated UAC Bypass Methods:** Two User Account Control (UAC) bypass methods that were no longer effective due to updates in operating system security protocols have been completely removed. This ensures that Xworm 6.5 relies only on current, verified techniques, maintaining a high standard of security and avoiding potential vulnerabilities associated with deprecated methods. Our commitment is to provide tools that are both powerful and secure, adapting to the evolving cybersecurity landscape.

*   **HRDP & Ngrok Integration Removed:** The integration with HRDP (Hidden Remote Desktop Protocol) and Ngrok has been fully removed. These functionalities are no longer supported within Xworm, allowing us to focus development resources on core features that deliver consistent value and performance. This decision helps streamline the application, reduce complexity, and ensure that all included features are robustly maintained and supported.

### 4. Critical Security Fix: RCE Vulnerability Addressed

A significant focus for the Xworm 6.5 release has been the remediation of critical security vulnerabilities. Specifically, all previous versions (v5.6 and below), whether cracked or original, were found to have a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**We are pleased to confirm that this critical RCE vulnerability has been completely fixed in Xworm 6.5.** This patch significantly enhances the security posture of the software, protecting legitimate users from potential exploits and ensuring the integrity of systems where Xworm 6.5 is deployed. Users of older versions are strongly advised to upgrade to Xworm 6.5 immediately to benefit from this crucial security enhancement. Our dedication to user security is paramount, and this fix underscores our commitment to delivering a safe and reliable product.
